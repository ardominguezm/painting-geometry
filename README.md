# Geometry of Emotion: Curvature Field in Paintings

This repository contains Python code for computing and visualizing **curvature fields in paintings**, exploring how mathematical geometry can reveal structural patterns of motion and emotion in visual art.

This repository accompanies the research paper submitted to the *Journal of Mathematics and the Arts* (Oct 2025), titled **"The Geometry of Emotion: Curvature and Flow in Paintings."**

## Overview
The analysis is based on the divergence of the normalized image gradient, estimating local curvature values that describe flow and texture dynamics.  
The method connects **differential geometry** with **aesthetic perception**.
